# Overview of the project : 
# Steps Involved:
Dataset Creation:

A small dataset of SMS messages is used, with labels indicating spam (1) or not spam (0).
Text Preprocessing:

Messages are converted to lowercase.
Punctuation is removed.
Messages are split into individual words.
Spam Classification:

A predefined set of spam-related keywords (e.g., win, free, congratulations, lottery, cash, offer) is used.
If a message contains any of these keywords, it is classified as spam (1); otherwise, it is classified as ham (0).
Evaluation & Accuracy:

The predicted labels are compared with actual labels to calculate accuracy.
Saving Results:

The predictions are saved in a CSV file (spam_predictions.csv) for further analysis.
# Outcome:
This approach provides a basic yet effective spam detection mechanism without using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. It is an easy-to-understand spam filter that can be improved by adding more keywords or using machine learning models in the future. ðŸš€
